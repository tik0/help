dpkg: purge versus remove

dpkg can be used to install, remove and check the current state of a package. Every package contains the following components

package binaries
configuration files
dpkg has two options --remove and --purge. Both these options are used to remove package contents. But there is a significant difference between the two.’

dpkg --remove is used to remove the package binaries. But if there are configuration files, those will not be removed

$ dpkg --remove package_name
After removing the package, the state of the package becomes un or rc.

dpkg --purge is used to remove the package binaries and the configuration files.

$ dpkg --purge package_name
After removing the package, the state of the package becomes un or pn.
